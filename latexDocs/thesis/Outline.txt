Abstract
Introduction
	Least Squares Introduction
	Integer Least Squares/Box Constrained Integer Least Sqaures Introduction

Search Process
	Schnorr-Euchner Unconstrained and Constrained Algorithms
		Modifications - Chang/Han constrained, Lower Bound, Initial Radius (review literature for more notable modifications)
	Best First Search/Best First Search Constrained
	Combined Best First/Depth First Search

Reduction
	Box Constrained Problems
		Previous Work (VBLAST/Sorted QR)
		New algorithms (CH/SW)
		Proof of equivalence of CH/SW
		New Algorithm
	Unconstrained Problems
		Introduction to LLL
		LLL + Permutations

Experiments
	Search Comparisons (CPU Time and Nodes Explored)
		Constrained   - Compare DFS before/after reductions
			        Compare Combined Search with DFS after reduction
		Unconstrained - Compare DFS before/after reductions
				Compare Combined Search with DFS after reduction
